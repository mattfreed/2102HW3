Problem Statement

For each of the following problems, write two solutions, where each solution solves the problem using a different approach. Approaches count as different if they cluster at least some subtasks of the problems differently (like we saw for the Rainfall solutions in lecture); mere syntactic differences, such as replacing an element-based for-loop with an index-based one, or moving code into a helper without changing the order of the underlying computation, don't count as different.
For each problem, you will be asked to identify (in a comment) the (sub)tasks that make up that problem. For Rainfall, we'd be looking for a sequence of phrases such as "summing elements, counting elements, ignoring negative elements, stopping at the -999". This wording doesn't need to be exact (it'll be graded by humans) â€“ they just need to convey the core computational tasks within the problem.

Please download and use this set of starter classes. The starter files contain all the classes needed for this assignment, as well as the classes in which to put your answers (to aid us in grading). You may add whatever methods you wish to these classes, but please don't rename any classes, fields, or methods. The section below on "Using the Starter Files" explains the starter files and where you should edit them with your solutions.

Programming Problems
Cable providers maintain lists of TV shows, their episodes, and their airdates. The starter files include a Show class and an Episode class. A Show contains a list of Episodes. The first two programming problems will refer to these classes.

Problem 1: The Show Sorter
A cable provider wants to organize its schedule into lists of daytime and primetime shows. Daytime shows have a start time at or after 6:00 am and before 5:00 pm. Primetime shows have a start time at or after 5:00 pm and before 11:00 pm. Any other start time is considered a nighttime broadcast and doesn't interest the cable provider at the moment.

Design a program called organizeShows that consumes a list of Shows and produces a report containing all of the daytime and primetime shows in the list. The shows within each list in the report should be in the same order as in the original list. You may assume that no two shows have the same name. Use the ShowSummary class in the starter files for the report.

A show's broadcast time is expressed in military (24-hour) time. For instance, if a show starts at 7:00 pm, then the value of broadcastTime will be 1900.

The starter files provide a concrete test case for this method.

Problem 2: Data Smoothing
In data analysis, smoothing a data set means approximating it to capture important patterns in the data while eliding noise or other fine-scale structures and phenomena. One simple smoothing technique is to replace each (internal) element of a sequence of values with the average of that element and its predecessor and successor. Assuming that extreme outlier values are an abberation caused, perhaps, through poor measurement, this averaging process replaces them with a more plausible value in the context of that sequence.
For example, consider this sequence of values:

  95 102 98 88 105
The resulting smoothed sequence should be
  95.0 98.33333 96.0 97.0 105.0
where:
102 was substituted by 98.33333: (95 + 102 + 98) / 3
98 was substituted by 96: (102 + 98 + 88) / 3
88 was substituted by 97: (98 + 88 + 105) / 3
(numbers such as 98.3333 do NOT need to be rounded or truncated).
This information can be plotted in a graph such as below, with the smoothed graph superimposed over the original values.

Graph not shown

Design a program dataSmooth that consumes a list of Shows, calculates the average runtime for each show, and produces a list of the smoothed runTime values (not the entire records). The average runtime is the sum of the runtimes of all episodes in the show divided by the number of episodes.

Problem 3: Earthquake Monitoring
Geologists want to monitor a local mountain for potential earthquake activity. They have installed a sensor to track seismic (vibration of the earth) activity. The sensor sends measurements one at a time over the network to a computer at a research lab. The sensor inserts markers among the measurements to indicate the date of the measurement. The sequence of values coming from the sensor looks as follows:
  20151004 200 150 175 20151005 0.002 0.03 20151007 130 0.54 20151101 78 ...
The 8-digit numbers are dates (in year-month-day format). Numbers between 0 and 500 are vibration frequencies (in Hz). This example shows readings of 200, 150, and 175 on October 4th, 2015 and readings of 0.002 and 0.03 on October 5th, 2015. There are no data for October 6th (sometimes there are problems with the network, so data go missing). Assume that the data are in order by dates (so a later date never appears before an earlier one in the sequence) and that all data are from the same year. The dates will always be 8-digit numbers in the format show above (and starting with a non-0 digit).
You may also assume that every date is followed by at least one frequency (in other words, every date has at least one measurement).

Design a program dailyMaxForMonth that consumes a list of sensor data (doubles) and a month (represented by a number between 1 and 12) and produces a list of reports (maxHzReport) indicating the highest frequency reading for each day in that month. Only include entries for dates that are part of the data provided (so don't report anything for October 6th in the example shown). Ignore data for months other than the given one. Each entry in your report should be an instance of the maxHzReport class in the starter files.

For example, given the sequence of values above and the month 10 (for October), the resulting list should be:

  [maxHzReport(20151004, 200),

   maxHzReport(20151005, 0.03),

   maxHzReport(20151007, 130)]
